# This file is automatically generated by the grid engine. The file contains
# mappings for the parameters found from the content server, which do not have
# mappings already defined. The point is that the query server cannot find 
# requested parameters without mappings. On the other hand, the order of the mappings
# is also the search order of the parameters that do not contain complete search 
# information (parameterIdType,levelIdType,levelId,level,etc.)
# 
# If you want to change some of the mappings or their order, then you should move
# them to a permanent mapping file (which is not automatically overridden.
